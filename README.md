# Basement-Bets

Basement-Bets is a discord bot coded in Python that allows server users to place bets and win points. The users can then redeem rewards and anyone who is a part of the betting game can take part in fun challenges!

Our original deployment for this is intended so we can have fun spontaniously choosing eachother's characters or roles in games for some fun games!

In order to deploy, please be sure to place your token for your bot, and the channel name for your bet-channel into the top declarations of Main.py

If you're using docker, you must instead just declare the ENV variables on the Dockerfile.

In order to approve bets as won or lost, you'll need a role within your server called 'Bet mods'. They can then use the :thumbs-up: or :thumbs-down: reactions on the original bet-placing message to declare it as won or not.

Enjoy! Any issues, please feel free to submit a pull request.
